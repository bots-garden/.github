## Bots.Garden ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ¼

Bots Garden is the house of various **[wasm](https://webassembly.org/)** and **[wasi](https://wasi.dev/)** experiments

The (most) active project of Bots Garden is **[Simplism](https://github.com/bots-garden/simplism)**: a cloud-native runtime for [Extism](https://extism.org/) **wasm** plug-ins.

Simplism is developed in Go with **[Wazero](https://wazero.io/)**[^1] as the Wasm runtime and **[Extism](https://extism.org/)**[^2], which offers a Wazero-based Go SDK and a Wasm plugin system.


There are two satellite projects of Simplism:

- [Simplism Builder](https://github.com/bots-garden/simplism-builder): a Docker Compose project bringing all the necessary tools to build WASM Extism plug-ins for Simplism.
- [Simplism IDE](https://github.com/bots-garden/simplism-ide): A "local cloud development environment" (with Docker Compose) to develop Extism plug-ins for Simplism without the need to install all the "complicated things".
